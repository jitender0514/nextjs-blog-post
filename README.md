# Blog master app

This is the simple blog post application using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) integration. This application includes the example of server and client components as well as how to make requests to MongoDB on server and client side.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setup and Run

- Configure the [`mongodb` ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) database or use [`cloud`](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/cloud) database service
- Create a `.env.local` file using `example.env` file

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
